					<p class="synopsis">
						As training to become a better game designer, I created this document to practice designing a custom Valorant Agent. I came up with all the abilities after a brainstorming session. I then iterated after receiving feedback from friends who play Valorant at various levels.<br><br>

				<h2>Audio Cues</h2>
				<ul class="video__name">
					<li>Dart makes noise when flying in the air like a Nerf Football</li>
					<li>Dart makes a noise when it hits a surface</li>
					<li>Player rotation is controlled by the right thumbstick. The spins around with no movement.</li>
					<li>Dart makes a noise when it is destroyed</li>
					<li>Dart makes a noise when it is initially shot</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Visual Cues</h2>
				<ul class="video__name">
					<li>Sonar-Outward scan similar to Sova’s, if dart is destroyed before it finishes scanning it’s full radius it doesn’ finish it’s scan past where the scan was when destroyed</li>
					<li>When a dart is destroyed, if it is mid-scan it’s sonar scan visual cue will turn red and fall down.</li>
					<li>Will mark scanned placed-abilities on mini-map</li>
					<li>Will make scanned abilities see-through through the wall for 1.5 seconds.</li>
				</ul>

				<img src="ValorantAgentAb2.png" alt="Valorant Agent Ability 2 Details">
				<p class="video__name">Effect duration is set to last longer than Brimstone so the ability is advantageous when compared. As opposed to having one Brimstone Stim Beacon stimming everybody, you can pick one or two teammates to stim and it has a longer-lasting effect compared.</p>
				<h2>Audio Cues</h2>
				<ul class="video__name">
					<li>When a player receives a stim (whether it is 27 self-stimming or another agent) a sound cue will play.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Visual Cues</h2>
				<ul class="video__name">
					<li>Players with a combat stim will have the combat stim effect surrounding them as they play until their stim effect ends.</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="video__name">Effect duration is set to last longer than Brimstone so the ability is advantageous when compared. As opposed to having one Brimstone Stim Beacon stimming everybody, you can pick one or two teammates to stim and it has a longer-lasting effect compared.</p>
				<h2>Audio Cues</h2>
				<ul class="video__name">
					<li>When the EMP blast is charging up, it will make a whirring sound that can be heard by nearby players, even through walls.</li>
					<li>When the EMP goes off it will make a powering down sound, whether there is an enemy or ability in the range or not</li>
					<li>When the EMP goes off, if there is at least one player or ability in the range of the EMP a hitmarker sound will play. This sound does not change whether it is an enemy or ability. This sound does not change whether it is one item or many.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Visual Cues</h2>
				<ul class="video__name">
					<li>When the EMP blast is charging up, there will be an outline of where the ability will have effects, showing up for both teammates and enemies.<br>This gives players in range the chance to move and the agents a chance to move their abilities.</li>
					<li>Suppressed players will have the suppressed effect surrounding them.</li>
				</ul>

				<img class="showcase-item" src="ValorantAgentEMP2.png" alt="Valorant Agent EMP">
				<p class="video__name">If 27 shot the EMP blast at the duck it would destroy the trapwire on the other side of the wall.</p>

				<img class="showcase-item" src="HitArea.png" alt="Valorant Agent EMP">
				<p class="video__name">Red box is the hit area of the blast if shot at the duck. Has a high hitbox so it has a high chance of hitting a Cypher camera or high-placed ability. If an enemy is caught in this box they will be suppressed.</p>

				<img class="showcase-item" src="HitArea2.png" alt="Valorant Agent EMP">
				<p class="video__name">If 27 shot the EMP blast at the duck the hit area would be similar to the red box</p>

				<img src="ValorantAgentUltAb.png" alt="Valorant Agent Ultimate Ability Details">
				<p class="video__name">When one portal is placed the player commits to the ult, meaning if they place one portal and not the other they do not get to try their ult again next round.<br><br>
					A portal must be placed in an area where there is a clearing that a player would be able to stand<br><br>
					A portal will be damaged if hit at its base or around its frame.
					</p>
				<h2>Audio Cues</h2>
				<ul class="video__name">
					<li>The portals make a constant whirring sound that can be heard when nearby if both portals are enabled.</li>
					<li>When one portal is placed the player will make their ult announcement to the whole game.</li>
					<li>When the second portal is placed, nearby players will hear the portals turn on and start whirring.</li>
					<li>A cue will play whenever the portal detects that 27 has vision of the portal.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Visual Cues</h2>
				<ul class="video__name">
					<li>If one portal is placed but the other isn’t the portal that is placed is see through as there is no portal connection.</li>
					<li>If both portals are placed other agents see one color where the portal is if 27 has no vision of the portal, if 27 has vision it has another color.</li>
					<li>A trail from where the portal is thrown is seen similar to Brimstone’s.</li>
				</ul>

				<h1 class="videos__title">Design Intent</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>Playstyle Goals:
						<ul>
							<li>27 was designed to be a penetrating agent, countering the strength of Sentinels like Cypher’s ability to shut down an entire site by themselves.</li>
							<li>27 is strong on attack, able to locate which sites have agent activity via placed abilities.</li>
							<li>27 is weaker on defense, however his utility gives teams a strong reason to play for retake and his Combat Stim would give defending sites an advantage in gunfights.</li>
							<li>Given information of placed abilities, players can decide whether to push a site or abandon it, but the information of abilities can assist a push by avoiding cameras, tripwires, turrets, orbs, etc.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Synergy
						<ul>The agent's abilities are designed to work against agents such as Cypher or Killjoy who are able to shutdown sites via their placed abilities.</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h1 class="videos__title">Post-Mortem</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>What went right:
						<ul>
							<li>Agent 27 seems like he would be a fun agent to play according to friends and fellow Valorant players.</li>
							<li>Agent 27 had a purpose and was able to complete his purpose.</li>
							<li>Agent 27 followed similar patterns to in-game Initiators, I believe if you looked at his abilities it would be obvious he is an Initiator.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>What went wrong:
						<ul>
							<li>Agent 27 is weak on defense, while he could be a strong attacker the agent seem very one-sided</li>
							<li>Agent 27 targets certain agents, putting some agents at a large disadvantage like Cypher or Viper. However, 27 also barely touches some agents, like Phoenix or Jett.</li>
							<li>Agent 27 is very similar to Kayo, if introduced into the game he would essentially make Kayo useless. This would need balancing to make both agents necessary.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="video__name">Over the course of this project I have grown interested in seeing how some of these abilities would react to the Valorant ecosystem. While I understand this character will likely never see the light of day, seeing some of these abilities created in some form with another agent would be interesting. Due to my limited contacts with professionals or high level play (above Immortal rank) it is unknown how a professional player would react or use this character. Still, this character will always be a Valorant agent. At least in my head-cannon.</p>
