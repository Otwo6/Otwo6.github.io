						Once upon a time, there was a great captain and his loyal crew. One day, they got lost at sea and a witch appeared. Without mercy, she killed the captain's crew. Leaving him stranded on an island, the captain stumbles upon an amulet containing the soul of his first mate. Together, the captain and his ghostly first mate set out to find the witch's amulet, which contains the rest of the captain's crew.<br><br>

					<li>The base mechanic for this game was the spiritual connection between the captain and his first mate.</li>
					<li>If the players seperated too far from each other the connection would break, leaving the first mate unable to move or interact with the world.</li>
				</ul>

				<img src="FriendShipSpiritBreaker.gif" alt="Thumbnail">
				<ul class="video__name">
					<li>Building on the initial mechanic I created an obstacle that would instantly break a connection if it was caught between the pair of pirates.</li>
					<li>No matter the distance between players, the connection would break.</li>
				</ul>

					<li>Concept developed early in the project to showcase our idea and inspiration from the project.</li>
					<li>This concept was developed in Photoshop by mashing together multiple projects, its sole purpose was to cement our ideas for the game and to keep our team on track.</li>
				</ul>

					<li>Example gif created early in the project to show the artist how I believed the movement should look for players.</li>
					<li>We decided against fully animating characters as that was not necessary in the short time we had to develop the game, instead we opted to having a dynamically bouncing sprite to represent movement in a cartoony way.</li>
				</ul>

				<img class="showcase-item" src="FriendShipLevelBlockout.png" alt="Thumbnail">
				<ul class="video__name">
					<li>Finished level puzzle compared to the initial blockout developed.</li>
					<li>Since this is one of the initial puzzles, I introduced the shooting mechanic to players here. This puzzle was after the ghost's ability to phase through walls was introduced, as seen in the blockout I wanted players to combine the mechanics to work together and unlock the door.</li>
					<li>On playtests however, this led to both players getting confused. This led me to remove the wall from this puzzle having the players focus solely on the introduction of the new shooting mechanic for the captain.</li>
